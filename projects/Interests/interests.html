        <p><h4>Why I interested in music?</h4> Music is a tool that a lot of people connect each others. As a human being I like music like other 8 billion people. Music help you to <strong>relax</strong>, <strong>be motivated</strong> and feel <strong>vulnerable</strong>. Sometimes the lyrics of the song can be related to me that is the one of the reason why I am interested in music.
        <h4>What kind of music do I like?</h4> There is many genres of music like over 6000 to 7000 which is a lot. I do not listen all of them, I would say I listen 100 to 200 genres. If I like the music I would listen that song but, my main genre is rap&#47;hip hop. Some people say if you like rap music how do you listen classic music? My answer is I listen to any music that is why. <br>
