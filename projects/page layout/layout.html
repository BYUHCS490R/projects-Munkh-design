            <p>Dota2 was come out in 2016 and it was already popular because of Dota1 or I should say Warcraft III. Warcraft III was came out in 2003 and had many games in it or maps, Dota1 was an one of the maps. It got popular and millions of people started playin around the world online or lan. DOTA meand defence of the anceint. <br>
            <br>The reason why it got so popular is Dota is so compatetive game and playing agains your friends would be awesome memory. At the time you do not realize how good that memory is because you are competing. Ten years later you would realize that it was an amazing feeling, which is how I felt now.
