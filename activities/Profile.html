    <h1>My name is Erdenemunkh</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I was born in Choibalsan, Dornod, Mongolia in 1999. I lived there untill 2017 and I moved to Ulaanbaatar wich is the capital city. After my highschool I did not wanted to study straight, so I traveled little bit and worked too. In my opinion traveling is way better than working <strong>working &lt; traveling</strong></p>
    <p>My childhood life is spent in Choibalsan city. Choibalsan city is located in east side of the country and the landscape is very flat. During summer it is very hot and winter time it is very cold. During summer break I went to countryside to my grandparents most of the time, I loved that time I spent with my grandparents when I was younger.</p>
